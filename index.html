        <h3 class="feature">jGrasp on the student laptops</h3>
        <p class="flow-text">
            Despite some debate involving jGrasp "corrupting" student-issued laptops, those have been resolved. jGrasp is open source software developed by Auburn University and is used in high school classrooms and universities throughout the world.
        </p>
        <h5 class="feature">Step 1: Installing BlueJ</h5>
        <p class="flow-text">
            BlueJ is necessary to install because it is prebuilt with the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is necessary for compiling java source code. BlueJ is provided by the HISD student software center and is recommended by the district.
        </p>

        <h5 class="feature">Step 2: Installing jGrasp</h5>
        <a href="/cdn/jgrasp203_04_patched.zip" class="btn red">Download jGrasp</a>
        <p class="flow-text">
            Download the patched version of jGrasp that comes with <code>win_run.exe</code> removed using the button above and extract to your desktop. <code>win_run.exe</code> needs to be removed for jGrasp to function properly on the student laptops.
        </p>
        <img class="responsive-img" src="/img/extract.png">
        <h5 class="feature">Step 3: Configuring jGrasp</h5>
        <p class="flow-text">
            jGrasp comes preconfigured to use the development environment that the JDK normally installs to, but the version of the JDK that we have is in an abnormal place (embedded within BlueJ). Here, we need to setup jGrasp to depend on the JDK located within BlueJ. Launch jGrasp using the <code>jgrasp.jar</code> file in the extracted folder.
        </p>
        <img class="responsive-img" src="/img/folder.png">
        <p class="flow-text">
            After you have launched jGrasp, open the PATH/CLASSPATH settings window.
        </p>
        <img class="responsive-img" src="/img/path_dropdown.png">
        <p class="flow-text">
            Once the PATH/CLASSPATH settings window is open, click the "new" button under the PATHS tab and paste the following and click "OK".<br /><br />Paste this: <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\BlueJ\jdk\bin</code>
        </p>
        <img class="responsive-img" src="/img/path_setting.png">
        <img class="responsive-img" src="/img/path_modal.png">
        <h5 class="feature">Step 4: Testing jGrasp</h5>
        <a href="/cdn/HelloWorld.java" class="btn red">Right-click and save as HelloWorld.java</a>
        <p class="flow-text">
            Once you have completed the previous steps, you should try compiling the test Java source file provided above. You can do this by using File -> Open and selecting the <code>HelloWorld.java</code> file, then pressing the green plus sign on the menu bar. <span style="font-weight:700;">When using jGrasp, you might see a warning about the stability of jGrasp. This is because the win_run.exe file was removed. It is safe to ignore this warning.</span>
        </p>

        <h5 class="feature">Step 5: You're done</h5>
        <p class="flow-text">
            If the file successfully compiles, you should see a message like the one below. Your jGrasp setup is fully functional. Happy coding!
